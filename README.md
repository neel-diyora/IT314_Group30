### User Stories 

> In this lab, we created the user stories along with their acceptance criteria covering all the functional and non-functional requirements where we bifurcated the requirements from the user perspective. 16 different user stories were designed and a description of them is in the link given below:

### Concept Mapping 
> In this lab, we created the concept maps of the functional and non-functional requirements that we will be developing in our application.

### Activity Diagram
> While making the activity diagram, we discussed different activities and triggers and the the diagrams for the corresponding activities page-wise.


### Class Diagram
> While making the class diagram, we discussed different types of classes and the relationship among them. Also about the cardinalities and and composition relations.


### Use Case Diagram
> While making the use-case  diagram, we discussed different types of actors, system boundaries, include and exclude requirements of our system and created the diagram.


### Use Case Documentation
> During making the use-case documentation, we discussed the actors, preconditions, postconditions, primary and alternative flow and exit conditions for each and every use case.


### Sequence Diagram
> During making the sequence diagram, we discussed the users, objects, activation, messages that a user should send to an object and responses of it.
